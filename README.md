This is a simple, responsive landing page built with ReactJS and Next.js. It showcases a clean design with dynamic components, interactive elements, and smooth user experience.

## Getting Started

## Features
**ReactJS & Next.js:** Utilizes the power of ReactJS for building the user interface and Next.js for server-side rendering, routing, and performance optimization.
**Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly on all device sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
**Dynamic Routing:** Easy-to-use routing with Next.js to navigate between pages.
**Styled Components:** Custom styles are applied to make the page visually appealing.
**Optimized Performance:** Utilizes Next.js's built-in features like image optimization and server-side rendering to improve performance.


## Technologies Used
**ReactJS:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
**Next.js:** React framework for building static and dynamic websites with server-side rendering.
**CSS Modules:** Scoped CSS styling for components.
**Tailwind CSS (optional):** For utility-first CSS styling (if included in the project).
**JavaScript (ES6+):** Modern JavaScript features and syntax.
**Next.js Image Optimization: **To improve loading times for images.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
